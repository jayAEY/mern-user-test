- Be prevented from logging in if password is incorrect
- See error message if account doesn't exist

## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- React
- React Router
- Bootstrap
- Express
- Node.js
- Mongoose
- MongoDB Compass
- Axios
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

- I originally did this project following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVyIIyZJutM. I then tried to redo the whole thing on my own and added some things (Home page leading to login/registration page, alerts for login errors, and successful login page) I definitely hope to implement all of these along with the sign up and login features in future projects. I also need to get more comfortable with backend work in general.
